When running customDAG in terminal, users need use run.py with inputting argumenta of a file name of graph G, a file name of graph G_0, a number of paths needed to be added, and a name of the output file. Then, the user can get a output file of results.
Example of input:
    CLee$ python3 run.py demo_G.txt demo_G_0.txt 5 output.txt
