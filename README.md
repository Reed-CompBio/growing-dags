This paper will be presented at the [Computational Network Biology workshop](https://cnbmac.org/cnb-mac-2022-schedule/), which is part of ACM-BCB in Chicago, IL August 7, 2022.

The `src/` directory contains code for generating growing DAGs and posting them to GraphSpace.  The `data/` directory contains interactomes and pathways (some of which may be output from [SPRAS](https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/spras)).
