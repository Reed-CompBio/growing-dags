### post.py & post_pathway.py
These two are used to put the output of DAG.py into graphspace. post.py puts the output while post_pathway puts the whole pathway, colouring the lines in the output. In the past, the output included G_0, but currently it doesn't so they might use a little modification. They both have my GraphSpace account hardcoded into them so you might want to change that in order to use it. They also automatically share the graphs to a group that has me(Tunc), Jiarong and Anna in it, so you might want to add yourself to the group if you are using it.
